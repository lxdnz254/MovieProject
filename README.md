Udacity Movie Project using TMDb Api Key and GridView

If your trying to run this code you need to obtain your own API key from [themoviedb.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup&sa=D&ust=1462084548918000&usg=AFQjCNFhnolSgPUuO3FsNxRMmkm35O6ykQ),
then replace "MyTMDbApiKey" in app/build.gradle with your own key

MPORTANT: PLEASE REMOVE YOUR API KEY WHEN SHARING CODE PUBLICALLY

If you ever upload your code to a public GitHub repo to share with other students or instructors, itâ€™s illegal to include your personal themoviedb.org API key. Please remove it and note in a README where it came from, so someone else trying to run your code can create their own key and will quickly know where to put it. Instructors and code reviewers will expect this behavior for any public GitHub code.

If you happen to commit your API key into version control on accident, check out this [GitHub](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/&sa=D&ust=1462084548925000&usg=AFQjCNGNZNAmJ32gnIwv_mLzRWWIh2EIUQ) guide on removing sensitive data in order to remove it.
